            <p>I'm a CS student currently, doing the marathone to become a skilled, software developer. <br> My background derives from hospitality and currently looking to career change. After 10+ years in hotels, <br> i have decided to offer my service
                skills in a completly different way. <br> After careful though on my passions and interest, i understood that, i naturally became accustom to code and computer.
                <br> I decided to look back right to school days, to understand what i true was good at and enjoyed doing it at the same time. <br> I knew straight away that a shift was needed. After taken the first steps of pursing a degree in Computer
                Science, <br>i have also dedicated to a growth mindset and began daily coding to sharpen my skills.</p>
